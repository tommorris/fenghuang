Fenghuang is a Scala FireEagle [1] library I'm working on. It isn't ready to be
used, but it will depend on: JodaTime and Databinder Dispatch. It is BDD-style
unit tested using Specs, and the 'mock traits' pattern I came up with [2].

I may add support for GeoJava, but it is *bloody complicated*. I may just reuse
the Java FireEagle library classes.

Patches welcome.
